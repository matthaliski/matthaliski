### Oh, hai ðŸ‘‹

Hello, friend. I'm Matt Haliski, and I build things on computers. Once upon a time, I wandered around the land of advertising, designing and doing front-end development for websites, Flash microsites, digital advertisements, social media campaigns, etc.

I eventually got hooked on Ruby on Rails, which made me feel like a superhero, so I struck out to build my own things. These days, I'm getting into building apps for Apple devices. Being in Xcode makes me feel a little like I did when using Flash Builder back in the day. Although we weren't doing declarative programming in ActionScript like in SwiftUI. That's been a bit of a learning curve!

Anyways, I love goofing around on computers and building stuff. Glad you could stop by.
